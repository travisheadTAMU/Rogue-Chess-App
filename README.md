# Rogue-Chess-App
Team 15 of ECEN 404 - Rogue Chess App - CapStone Design 2022

Team Members (Subsystems):
Travis Head (Artificial Intelligence), Jose Herrera (Game & App Functionality)

This repository was created by Travis Head and Jose Herrera for the Rogue Chess App team for Texas A&M UNiversity Senior Capstone Project. The Rogue Chess App provides a new variation of chess app via an Android app for Android mobile devices. The user selects whether they will play against the Artificial Intelligence or against another person by selecting "Single Player" or "Player Vs. Player" respectiviely. The user then selects the difficulty of the randomization on the user's pieces. The user will then begin playing a chess game where the user's pieces may disobey their inputs. Tap a piece to select it and then a highlighted square to move the piece. Tap the piece again before moving to deselect.

Code, files, data, and results for individual subsystems can be found inside of each subsystem folder. Full system testing, data, and results can be found in the /Validation folder.
